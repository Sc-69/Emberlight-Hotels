# Emberlight Hotels

## FrontEnd Development in HTML and CSS

### by Salim Ege Caliskan

 Emberlight Hotels is an imaginary hotel-chain, for which I coded a landing page. I do not own the hero image; it is from pexels.com and all rights go to its original owner. Logo is AI generated.

 My goal is to focus on the navigation bar and the footer; with minimalistic content which might feature a booking form. I use mobile-first approach. I also created a functional dropdown menu.

Takeaways: Practiced flexbox and grid layouts. I feel pretty comfortably styling pages using CSS. Also my CSS is becoming a lot cleaner. In comparison, I start to use shorter code to achieve the desired results.

-Added a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
-Refractored Javascript functions and separated them from the HTML.
-Reworked the CSS and HTML a little, using class toggling for styling.

## UPDATE

Started designing "Rooms" page where I wanted to practice async js by fetching API as well as pagination using only pure javascript.

I completed the fundamental design of the page using the main CSS file as well as some additions; made an API call using JSONPlaceholder for some images; which I iterated through to create 5 list elements on the page.

Todo: Add pagination.
