# Emberlight Hotels

## FrontEnd Development in HTML and CSS

### by Salim Ege Caliskan

 Emberlight Hotels is an imaginary hotel-chain, for which I coded a landing page. I do not own the hero image; it is from pexels.com and all rights go to its original owner.

 My goal is to focus on the navigation bar and the footer; with minimalistic content which might feature a booking form. I use mobile-first approach. I also created a functional dropdown menu.

Takeaways: Practiced flexbox and grid layouts. I feel pretty comfortably styling pages using CSS. Also my CSS is becoming a lot cleaner. In comparison, I start to use shorter code to achieve the desired results.
